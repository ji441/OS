# OS
the operating system course project

# project 1 linker
this project simulate the linker of an operating system by reading input from file.
# project 2 process_scheduler
this project use discerete event simulation (DES) to construct a process scheduler. Implement FIFO, SRTF(shortest time remaining), roundRobin, priority and preemptive priority algorithm.
# project 3 Virtual_memory
this project simulates the virtual memory management and implement FIFO,Random,Clock,Enhanced Second Chance, Aging,Working set algorithm for selecting victim virtual pages.
# project 4 IO_scheduler
this is similar to the process_scheduler, with the difference that we do not use DES anymore. This project provides a scheduler for the hard disk to do IO, and use one move of the disk head as one time unit. FIFO, shortest time first, LOOK, CLOOK, FLOOK algorithm are implemented.
